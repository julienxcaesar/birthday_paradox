# birthday_paradox
Also called the birthday problem

--The Birthday Paradox, also called the Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high probability 
that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people. 
In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance of two people having a matching birthday. 
But even in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent chance of a matching birthday. 
This program performs several probability experiments to determine the percentages for 
groups of different sizes. We call these types of experiments, in which 
we conduct multiple random trials to understand the likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments.
